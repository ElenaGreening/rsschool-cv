## About me
While studying in bootcamp, on average I spent 10 hours a day learning and doing practical tasks.
At the moment, I am enjoying studying in RS-school and creating a social network using React.
My real work experience was creating a functioning web-site with a team.
Some of my favourite ~~hobbies~~ are writing plans and structuring informational chaos.
In a team I am able to create positive and productive relationships, regardless of whether they are robots, children or
grownup programmers.

## Skills
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * JS 
  * React
  * Git
  * Figma

## Code Example


```
document.getElementById('firstNameUp').addEventListener('click', sortNameAZ )
function sortNameAZ (){
removeRows()
let sortedByNameAZ = tableData.sort(function (obj1, obj2){
if (obj1.name.firstName < obj2.name.firstName)
{return -1}
else if (obj1.name.firstName > obj2.name.firstName) {
return 1}
return 0;
})
createTR(sortedByNameAZ)
}

document.getElementById('firstNameDown').addEventListener('click', sortNameZA)

function sortNameZA (){
removeRows()
console.log('hello StasZA')
let sortedByFirstNameZA = tableData.sort(function (obj1, obj2){

        if(obj1.name.firstName>obj2.name.firstName){
            return -1;
        }
        else if (obj2.name.firstName>obj1.name.firstName){
            return 1;
        }
        return 0;
    })
    createTR(sortedByFirstNameZA)
}

```

## Work Experience
*2022*

Participated in making a web-site for an investment company. Where I created a form for sending customers details
using php and made a custom input search.

*2021*

While studying front-end web development, I learned HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JS, and the basics of React.
Made several Web layouts based on Figma design, using principles of response and adaptivity.
I learned JS to a level that was high enough to create interactive web-page and display dynamically changing content.
All completed tasks were uploaded to GitLab.
As a pet project I made a web-site for pizza delivery.
- created the layout with pizza cards.
- created popups with dynamically changing data, where the customer would be able to change the toppings, ingredients, thickness and the size of pizza.
